New Recording 17.m4a 
 

 Speaker 1 

And I went to introduce myself, and it was like 3 months after I started. 

 Speaker 1 

And he's like you, it people are all the same. 

 Speaker 1 

It sucks. 

 Speaker 1 

It's been nothing you're all promises and you deliver nothing of value to me. 

 Speaker 1 

Why are you just getting coming to meet me now? 

 Speaker 1 

I was like dude like my response was going to be. 

 Speaker 1 

Like you didn't even say hi to me when I. 

 Speaker 1 

Pass by you in the hall, like right? 

 Speaker 1 

Like our offices were on like the opposite side. 

 Speaker 1 

Of the wall of each other and the dude like never, you know. 

 Speaker 1 

So I just said not. 

 Speaker 1 

A problem you know and I. 

 Speaker 1 

Had a I had a strategy to go through and just it was in a retail organization. 

 Speaker 1 

He was VP of. 

 Speaker 1 

All retail of. 

 Speaker 1 

All retail stores. 

 Speaker 1 

And so we're going to replace. 

 Speaker 1 

The entire technology stack in the retail stores and I came to when I said hey, I'm excited about. 

 Speaker 1 

This we've done these calculations. 

 Speaker 1 

We think we can save, you know, like next million dollars. 

 Speaker 1 

A year in reoccurring revenue. 

 Speaker 1 

I mean recurring costs, and he's like that's complete crap, right? 

 Speaker 1 

He was really like nasty. 

 Speaker 1 

For the first time. 

 Speaker 1 

I met him and I said OK. 

 Speaker 1 

Well, you know we you. 

 Speaker 1 

Know the CFO agrees with us. 

 Speaker 1 

We've looked at the numbers we calculated. 

 Speaker 1 

You know we spend spend X number of dollars in MPLS annually. 

 Speaker 1 

You know so forth and so on. 

 Speaker 1 

We have no security controls. 

 Speaker 1 

There's no firewalls, you know there's no wireless in the retail stores, right? 

 Speaker 1 

So there's you know. 

 Speaker 1 

And so we we got done with the project and the dude called me in his office. 

 Speaker 1 

He's like Dyson, I gotta eat, grow right like here's a gift certificate. 

 Speaker 1 

I'm giving one to each one of your. 

 Speaker 1 

Teams 'cause what I said to you. 

 Speaker 1 

Was not, you know, I judged off of what I'd seen in. 

 Speaker 1 

The past and was obviously having a bad day. 

 Speaker 1 

But from there on out like I had a relationship but I had to prove to him and it took me six months to prove to him and I had to show the numbers at the tail end that he would have that savings. 

 Speaker 1 

So every $1.00 he sold at retail, right? I I increased the margin by 30% because of the cost savings to that organization, right? So that spoke to him, yeah? 

 Speaker 2 

Second, really. 

 Speaker 3 

So you said that one thing that you're worried about is it's presenting right to the executives of dance. 

 Speaker 4 

And so. 

 Speaker 3 

The very first presentation that I had for executives and knocked it out of the park. 

 Speaker 3 

Right is is. 

 Speaker 3 

You got to think like the higher you go. 

 Speaker 3 

So the the lesson? 

 Speaker 3 

It's like a resume right? 

 Speaker 3 

You get 30 seconds of their attention and it's gone. 

 Speaker 5 

Yeah, yeah. 

 Speaker 3 

And so the very first time I knew is like I need to create a dashboard for them is all manual, but it's just to show them right present. 

 Speaker 4 

Well, right? 

 Speaker 6 

That's it. 

 Speaker 3 

Very little words, all colors. 

 Speaker 3 

But then what I did is I went and investigated on their LinkedIn accounts. 

 Speaker 3 

The college they went to and then I turned all of the dashboard into. 

 Speaker 3 

Each of the exam. 

 Speaker 3 

Negatives like colors of their alma mater's and I put, like the little symbols of their things, and it was like they paid deep attention 'cause they were waiting for the next one like well, who's college is coming up next, and they're talking trash and doing all this stuff. 

 Speaker 3 

But then it was like there, boom, I didn't have to do that again, right? 

 Speaker 3 

But like every time they had an. 

 Speaker 3 

Understanding of what was? 

 Speaker 3 

He went on. 

 Speaker 5 

That's good, wow. 

 Speaker 3 

And and they came to me, and they said, it was the very first time, and they're like well in their career at Experian. 

 Speaker 3 

They felt comfortable with. 

 Speaker 3 

Security, but before 'cause it was like some. 

 Speaker 3 

Spreadsheet and I. 

 Speaker 3 

Could see their eyes glazing over for my predecessors. 

 Speaker 3 

So just you gotta think like by the time you're at the C-Suite, it's like, can I do this in crayon? 

 Speaker 4 

Red, yellow, green. 

 Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think another. 

 Speaker 1 

Thing I agree with that 100%. 

 Speaker 4 

Small pictures. 

 Speaker 1 

I think it must. 

 Speaker 4 

Representative pictures. 

 Speaker 5 

Just think it's stupid simple. 

 Speaker 4 

Yeah Peter, really. 

 Speaker 1 

Knowing your audience and what they're needing to know and what they're going to do with the information, if you're gonna present to somebody something if they ask for it, and you don't think they need it, you still give it to him. 

 Speaker 1 

But like just a board, need to know the number of vulnerabilities that you have. 

 Speaker 1 

Of if you know maybe they do, or maybe they do. 

 Speaker 1 

Don't what are they? 

 Speaker 1 

Gonna do with that action. 

 Speaker 1 

Well, I mean with that. 

 Speaker 1 

Data, what action are they going to take because? 

 Speaker 1 

A board, for example, has a fiduciary responsibility. 

 Speaker 1 

To for certain things. 

 Speaker 1 

So, knowing what the responsibility of the target audiences and tailor that to what is useful for them for information. 

 Speaker 3 

And then my last nugget, 'cause I gotta run is a. 

 Speaker 3 

Never tell your CEO a problem without a signal without a hey, we're on it. 

 Speaker 3 

We're doing this. 

 Speaker 3 

'cause otherwise, like why the hell are? 

 Speaker 3 

You here all right? 

 Speaker 3 

So yeah, just. 

 Speaker 3 

Even if it's. 

 Speaker 3 

We're researching into it or whatever, but. 

 Speaker 3 

Never never tell a problem without some plan of action that you're already in to the train your. 

 Speaker 3 

That'll help their relationships. 

 Speaker 1 

Team did it as well. 

 Speaker 2 

Second one. 

 Speaker 5 

Yeah, yeah. 

 Speaker 6 

Thank you. 

 Speaker 3 

So like so like I shake. 

 

That was awesome. 

 Speaker 4 

The attention span. 

 

We found this. 

 Speaker 4 

Of the individuals, the higher you go. 

 Speaker 3 

Like here. 

 Speaker 4 

Up there so. 

 Speaker 4 

That is so if you get. 

 Speaker 5 

Right? 

 Speaker 4 

To the CEO, their attention span I came, you know, somewhere between 30 seconds in a minute. 

 Speaker 4 

And then they're off talking about it. 

 Speaker 1 

And that's if it's a. 

 Speaker 4 

Good CEO and that's you know. 

 Speaker 4 

Then they're bringing on like eight other things because they they're looking at. 

 Speaker 5 

Line has OCD. 

 Speaker 7 

So yeah. 

 Speaker 4 

You know the Super high level. 

 Speaker 4 

So sometimes what you think might be like the problem we really want talk about. 

 Speaker 4 

Isn't it? 

 Speaker 4 

Search for the old style. 

 Speaker 1 

Any other technologies? 

 Speaker 4 

Like what what's it going to change? Once again, influence the business? What are you really doing? That's the value, and that's not just CEO. It's also the VP. So that goes to the Tyler's example. 

 Speaker 2 

The story. 

 Speaker 7 

Right? 

 Speaker 2 

They did. 

 Speaker 4 

But it's I mean I I gotta. 

 Speaker 2 

Slow down. 

 Speaker 4 

I got a lot of examples of. 

 Speaker 4 

Well, when I. 

 Speaker 4 

Was young. 

 Speaker 4 

How do you talk to CEOs? 

 Speaker 4 

Yeah 20, you know I'm 21 and it's. 

 Speaker 2 

Second line. 

 Speaker 4 

It's like, well, what do I say? 

 Speaker 4 

And you know what? 

 Speaker 4 

They're just like everybody else in realizing. 

 Speaker 4 

That most people are scared about. 

 Speaker 4 

If you manage to just talk to them. 

 Speaker 4 

Like as a person or one-on-one with. 

 Speaker 4 

Something that's gonna make sense to. 

 Speaker 4 

Them you got it, that's. 

 Speaker 4 

Just be yourself. 

 Speaker 5 

One problem we're having this great advice to help you last is that the board has the startup has been there for 12 years and it's the same executives the whole time, most of them, and they've only been a fun ride since the beginning. 

 Speaker 5 

That was like the beginning of their whole career, so they don't know. 

 Speaker 5 

Best practice is for security. 

 Speaker 5 

Outside of that, and it hasn't been. 

 Speaker 5 

A problem now because. 

 Speaker 5 

They've only you know, they're just growing. 

 Speaker 2 

Second, no, we don't need to. 

 Speaker 5 

They're just getting in the Wi-Fi, so there hasn't been. 

 Speaker 5 

Any significant attacks or anything, right? 

 Speaker 5 

Second, or he understands it, but he doesn't communicate that to the rest of the company. 

 Speaker 5 

So like when I try to implement. 

 Speaker 5 

Dev cycles those developers like OK, cool they can't do it because their managers are wanting them to produce more code faster instead of. 

 Speaker 2 

Not really serious. 

 Speaker 2 

2nd we need drop down by none then. 

 Speaker 4 

Figure out what you want. 

 Speaker 4 

See go to call the executives. 

 Speaker 4 

Have him be the messenger. 

 Speaker 1 

He said damn it said generally do any s s. 

 Speaker 4 

Any s s would be a really good. 

 Speaker 1 

Yeah, you did it for yourself for your own company. 

 Speaker 1 

Right out there with like a summary like that. 

 Speaker 5 

Right, you get a 30 minute. 

 Speaker 1 

Yet still sit down and spend some hours yourself, right? 

 Speaker 1 

And just take separate yourself from like being in their company and then say here are the business objectives. 

 Speaker 1 

Here are the security objectives. 

 Speaker 1 

Here are goals. 

 Speaker 1 

And then here are the things. 

 Speaker 1 

That used to go from. 

 Speaker 5 

OK. 

 Speaker 1 

You still can't do it. 

 Speaker 4 

Can throw. 

 Speaker 5 

Right, that's how it made the road map follow the mist framework. 

 Speaker 5 

Little that made the road map, but it makes sense. 

 Speaker 2 

Sounds good. 

 

Would be good. 

 Speaker 2 

Second well, so. 

 Speaker 5 

Is missing though. 

 Speaker 5 

Is being. 

 Speaker 5 

I see. 

 Speaker 5 

No technically. 

 Speaker 4 

It states. 

 Speaker 4 

Right? 

 Speaker 4 

So what I? 

 Speaker 4 

I think I missed not having much. 

 Speaker 4 

Want to spend a day to cover? 

 Speaker 4 

At the same time. 

 

You know that once. 

 Speaker 4 

I'm able to. 

 Speaker 4 

Really bring together a whole set of new offers. 

 Speaker 4 

The influence I will have so much more massive. 

 Speaker 4 

So in other words, it will. 

 Speaker 4 

It'll be multi times so many other companies that. 

 Speaker 1 

Second hand doesn't really have customer Jackie, so he's still in the market, right? 

 Speaker 4 

You know, change the way that we implement things. 

 Speaker 1 

So and she, she's yeah, I think you're going to take where you were and what satisfies you. 

 Speaker 1 

Then you're going to get even more of that. 

 Speaker 4 

Yeah Oh yeah. 

 Speaker 4 

The well that's part of why I wanted to join my sandbox. 

 Speaker 4 

Was too small. 

 Speaker 1 

Then it had a bunch of. 

 Speaker 1 

Cats refuse it at night. 

 

You guys have your own. 

 

You guys have your. 

 Speaker 5 

Own language already. 

 Speaker 1 

And for me Max I'm not like. 

 Speaker 1 

I like to make connections with people. 

 Speaker 1 

I like to influence organizations and. 

 Speaker 1 

Help them to change. 

 Speaker 1 

I don't like it when I. 

 Speaker 1 

Come into an organization. 

 Speaker 5 

And the first like. 

 Speaker 1 

Year there they listen and. 

 Speaker 1 

They embrace all this change. 

 Speaker 1 

And then they lose steam. 

 Speaker 1 

And I'm not able to enact much change after that. 

 Speaker 1 

In this scenario I get. 

 Speaker 1 

To work, I work with one plus for now for 10. 

 Speaker 1 

Months right and? 

 Speaker 1 

They trust me. 

 Speaker 1 

Their CIO loves me. 

 Speaker 1 

There she still loves me. 

 Speaker 1 

Their CEO loves me and I get to work with them a little bit when they work with me, they understand there's a cost associated with it. 

 Speaker 1 

And if they listen or they don't, that's that's their fault, right, right? 

 Speaker 1 

And I just make sure what I put together in writing. 

 Speaker 1 

I'm an advisory. 

 Speaker 1 

Personally, what I put together from a strategy perspective is then put it in writing, writing as well so. 

 Speaker 1 

I see why it. 

 Speaker 5 

Feels like your roles. 

 Speaker 5 

Are more like a VC, so virtually summer. 

 Speaker 5 

What's that other term? 

 Speaker 5 

They call it? 

 Speaker 4 

Where's C-Suite whisperers? It's not just the C, so let's see the CIO CEO. 

 Speaker 5 

Well, there was a chat that's obvious. 

 Speaker 1 

Second, VC stars are a little bit watered down now. 

 Speaker 5 

I thought, uh VC. 

 Speaker 5 

So just when you receive so. 

 Speaker 5 

For multiple conquest. 

 Speaker 5 

So what I. 

 Speaker 6 

Second, yeah, and and so it could be a really good virtual C, so could be what we are. 

 Speaker 1 

A majority of VC sales right now I've. 

 Speaker 1 

Never been a Cecil before. 

 Speaker 1 

But we import product teams and Saturday the products. 

 Speaker 1 

Well, I mean, are we talking to Sarah earlier? 

 Speaker 1 

Here you know we'll talk about partnerships with with those organizations to be able to you. 

 Speaker 1 

Know make the things that. 

 Speaker 1 

We offer to customers stronger. 

 Speaker 1 

Yeah, you know that kind of stuff. 

 Speaker 2 

2nd right now we don't. 

 Speaker 5 

Do you take insurance? 

 Speaker 4 

Yeah, but we pre meeting you and if there's some packaging for you. 

 Speaker 5 

I think it was appreciated. 

 Speaker 4

 Speaker 5 

Thank you so much, I'll I'll share. 

 Speaker 4 

Find me online. 

 Speaker 1 

File with you and cliffs as well and we've connected already, so yeah, I don't know. 

 Speaker 6 

Work will take. 

 Speaker 1 

Take a few minutes, go through that plan. 

 Speaker 1 

Right for your company. 

 Speaker 5 

Uh, you know? 

 Speaker 1 

Confidentially, if you want to go through. 

 Speaker 1 

You know what? 

 Speaker 1 

You come up with. 

 Speaker 1 

With somebody bouncing off with somebody who would be willing to. 

 Speaker 1 

Help so. 

 Speaker 6 

Give you this. 

 Speaker 4 

And only mention names. 

 Speaker 2 

Second, 'cause then that's. 

 Speaker 4 

Not about things like this. 

 Speaker 4 

Love you. 

 Speaker 4 

It's not necessarily about the work that you're doing in the company, it's how do you move up. 

 Speaker 4 

Or maybe our skills. 

 Speaker 1 

But define had us on what you're looking for, so if you clearly set an expectation for that, that meant or what you're looking for, so you know, like former CEO of Akamai, who's now the soul of Aqua, his name is Andy Ellison. 

 Speaker 2 

Yes, what do want? 

 Speaker 6 

I think he will. 

 Speaker 1 

You know, I know he's somebody you. 

 Speaker 1 

Know somebody that I've? 

 Speaker 1 

Looked up to in. 

 Speaker 6 

The past right? 

 Speaker 1

If you wanted connections with other see shows, let me know, right so? 

 Speaker 5 

Thank you so much, I appreciate it.
